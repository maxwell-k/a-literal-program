Why? Love?

.. note::

    -   why this paper?

        -   open question: arguments for and against literate programming
        -   topical, growing in popularity:

            -   software engineer for 7 business days
            -   ODSC - iPython / Jupyter notebooks - IBM

        -   history:

            -   fascinating
            -   I have a lot to learn

        -   engineering
        -   oftern old fashioned tools are the best

            -   vim, SQLite, …
            -   Unix command line
            -   even got into PowerShell

    -   [overview]
    -   informal

        -   questions at the end
        -   a few surveys

.. note::

    -   June 1986: most people had stopped debating whether ``goto`` were
        acceptable

    -   Communications of the ACM

        -   since 1957
        -   Association for Computing Machinery - world's largest computing
            society
        -   science magazine, trade journal and scientific journal
        -   typically summaries of research

    -   Don Knuth

        -   46 years old, (born in 10 January 1938 so 48 in June 1986)
        -   Won Turing award from the ACM 12 years earlier computing's Nobel
            prize
        -   The Art of Computer Programming (published volumes one to three)
        -   hexadecimal dollar for errors: $2.56
            cheques likely framed or scanned led to scammers
        -   TeX: version numbers approaching π

    -   Doug McIlory

        -   “I had the good fortune to head the research department at Bell
            Labs in which Unix was born, and to work with some of the most
            creative talents in computing”
        -   Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan
        -   software components
        -   "The real hero of programming is the one who writes negative code"

Literature
----------

| Second, small assignment statements are grouped
| several to the line with no particularly clear rationale.
| This convention saves space; but the groupings
| impose a false and distracting phrasing, like “poetry”
| produced by randomly breaking prose into lines.


-   inviting to read
-   “Most real programs are written to be executed but not read”
-   “good writing requires good reading-you can’t write a novel if you’ve never
    read one“
-   ““literate programming” implies that its practitioners must be competent in
    both literature and programming; it is hard enough to find people with one
    of those skills, let alone both”

-   a message from its authors to its readers
-   literate programming vs semi-literate - ordering
-   Jupyter notebooks - how many people?
-   Pascal how many people?
-   WEB system:

    -   weave: produces tex source, compiled
    -   tangle: produces Pascal source
